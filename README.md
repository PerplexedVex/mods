# mods
To use, install minecraft forge version 1.18.1 recommended.

Press the windows button, type %appdata% then hit enter. 
Find the .minecraft folder.
In this folder, make an empty folder called mods
if you already have this folder, make sure its empty.
Extract the mods.zip into this folder.

Should work now probably
